# Recommendation_Autoencoder_Pytorch
The code is a Stacked Autoencoder made using Pytorch. It takes as input ratings of movies seen by a user and predicts ratings for movies not seen by them i.e. the the blank spaces in the input vector. The following code predicts the rating within an 0.95 of the actual rating when tested. The datasets provided (i.e. ml- 1m.zip and ml- 100k) have been taken from https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/
